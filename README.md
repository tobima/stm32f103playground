## Development setup

In order to flash the STM32F103 Development Kit, only the following cabels must be connected:

On the ARM-JTAG of the 

| Pin | Connector | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | VCC | This is the traget board Vcc. It is used by the STLINK/V2
| 7 | TMS/SWDIO | The SWD Data signal
| 8 | GND | Be sure there is a common ground
| 9 | TCK/SWCLK | The SWD Clock Signal
| 15 | nSRST/RESET | System reset – probably optional

On the STM32F4 DISCOVERY Board the programmer (ST-LINK) can be used to programm the STM32F103.
Simply disconnect both jumpers of **CN3**.

Connect the following Pins of **CN2**

| Pin | CN2 | Designation | ARM JTAG PIN |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | - | VDD from application | |
| 2 | SWCLK | SWD clock | 9 |
| 3 | GND | Ground | 8 |
| 4 | SWDIO | SWD data input/output | 7 |
| 5 | NRST | RESET of target MCU | 15 |
| 6 | - | Reserved | |

The **Pin 1** of the ARM-JTAG can be connected to **3V** pin of the *STM32F4 DISCOVERY-BOARD*, so only one USB Connection to the PC is necessary to power the whole system.


## PIN Background

### STM103 JTAG

 JTAG Signals

| Signal | Connects to... |
| --- | --- | 
| TMS (SWDIO) | Test Mode State pin — Use 100K Ohm pull-up resistor to VCC. |
| TDO (SWO) | Test Data Out pin. |
| RTCK | JTAG Return Test ClocK. (see Note below) |
| TDI |	Test Data In pin — Use 100K Ohm pull-up resistor to VCC. |
| TRST | Test ReSeT/ pin — Use 100K Ohm pull-up resistor to VCC. TRST is optional and not available on some devices. You may leave it unconnected. |
| TCLK (SWCLK) | Test CLocK pin — Use 100K Ohm pull-down resistor to GND. |
| VCC |	Positive Supply Voltage — Power supply for JTAG interface drivers. |
| GND |	Digital ground. |
| RESET | RSTIN/ pin — Connect this pin to the (active low) reset input of the target CPU. |
